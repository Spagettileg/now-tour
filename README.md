'Now-Tour' website was created to help showcase a highly interactive aproach to booking a holiday. There are many travel websites in the current market place, but many fail to deliver on getting a balance between use of narrative, imagery and interactive website functionality.

A single page website has been created to avoid the user having to navigate to many web pages that can result in a frustrating user experience.

Bootstrap was the chosen framework for styling my project. I used the Bootstrap grid extensively to support responsiveness on mobile, tablet and desktop devices. 

### Colour Palette
Colours used in this project were sourced from [visme.co](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/). Essentially, the colours are seeking to capture key attributes of Papa's Tops Pizza through fresh, appetising, full flavour and wholesome
