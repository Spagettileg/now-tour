This project is designed to showcase a front end design built with the following

'Now-Tour' website was created to help showcase a highly interactive aproach to booking a holiday. There are many travel websites in the current market place, but many fail to deliver on getting a balance between use of narrative, imagery and interactive website functionality.

A single page website has been created to avoid the user having to navigate to many web pages that can result in a frustrating user experience.

### CSS Framework
Bootstrap was the chosen framework for styling my project. I used the Bootstrap grid extensively to support responsiveness on mobile, tablet and desktop devices. 

### Colour Palette
Colours used in this project were sourced from [visme.co](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/). Essentially, the colours are seeking to capture key attributes of travel through new horizons, fun, energy and relaxation.

Royal Blue         | #3486E5 
Very Light Grey    | #F2F2F2 
White Colour       | #FFFFFF 
Gun Metal Grey     | #4D4D4D 
Pencil Grey        | #808080 
Foggy Grey         | #B3B3B3
Charcoal Grey      | #333333
Smokey Grey        | #EEEEEE     
Black              | #000000 

### Typography
[Vollkorn](https://fonts.google.com/) and [sans-serif](https://fonts.google.com/) fonts were used throughout this project.

### Icon Graphics
Font Awesome 5 icon graphics were used in conjunction with Bootstrap 4, primarily to support the features section, as viewed in `index.html` page 

Page                   | Function                  | Font  
-----------------------|---------------------------|-------
index.html             | Return to top button      | `fas fa-angle-double-up`

### Navbar Design
For all device viewpoints, the navbar offers 4 functions on show. The navbar has been designed to both collapse and open on all devices / viewpoints via a Javascript toggle control
